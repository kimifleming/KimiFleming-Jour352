<h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Multimedia Desk Reporter</h3>

    <h4>The Diamondback</h4>

    <h5>Jan 2020 - Present</h5>

    I attend a weekly staff meeting and pitch stories I would be interested in covering that week. The stories I cover are either formatted as short documentary-style videos or natural sound packages. I then work with other reporters and my editor to produce the best version of the video before it is published.

  <h3>Deputy Crew Chief</h3>

    <h4>Capital News Service</h4>

    <h5>Dec 2019 - Present</h5>

    I coordinate with four other crew chiefs on specific details about the technical side
    of the Maryland Newsline nightly broadcasts, assisting anchors and producers in order to produce a clean show. My other responsibilities include organizing shows in the TriCaster and technical directing newscasts, as well as organizing and educating volunteers about their roles in the studio.

  <h3>Social Media Editor</h3>

    <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>

    <h5>August 2019 - Present</h5>

      <p>I curate the newspaperâ€™s social media, promoting all published content on Twitter
    and Facebook. I also started an Instagram account for the publication, where I choose one featured story each week for an Instagram post.</p>

  <h3>Multimedia Reporter</h3>

    <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4>

    <h5>August 2018 - Dec 2019</h5>

      <p>I pitched two stories weekly, reporting on one story per week regarding news within the University of Maryland or College Park area. In the field, I shot B-roll footage and multiple interviews per story on both DSLR and broadcast cameras. I then produced a brief reporter package or natural sound package using Adobe Premiere Pro and worked with my editor on each video package to ensure quality.</p>
